            ok so like a few days ago i went down a rabbit hole of learning about lace code in boots and it turns out to actually be super 
            interesting! <br> <br>

            so, lace code is a way to communicate your beliefs and ideologies through the colour of your laces, and i think that is pretty cool! 
            some things to note though: this is post is generalising a lot of the nuances in lace code found across different parts of the world.
            also, the things i talk about can just mean that someone likes the colour (which is usually the case if their shoelaces are the same 
            colour as their hair or something) and, most importantly, it like doesn't exist anymore (and it didn't <em> really </em> exist in  
            many places to begin with) but in my opinion it still really cool to learn about <br> <br>

            anyhow red, blue and white almost always meant that you should stay away from the wearers, even if it was just as a precaution because
            saying that their meanings are crazy is a <strong> HUGE </strong> understatement. red meant that the person was neo-nazi and more than
            likely an aggressive person in general. blue was that they murdered an officer, which speaks for itself. white usually signified that 
            the wearer was racist and believed in white supremacy-like ideologies and hate foreigners although some sources state that it has now 
            changed to be a sign of peace (either way, this code isn't prevalent anymore). i think all of these would have been so scary at the time
            because, not only did the people with these laces believe in these things, they were so proud of them that they would openly display it 
            on clothing... <br> <br>

            okay, moving on to the nicer ones... <br>
            black was the colour of neutrality, as they were (and still are) the default colour on many boots, such as docs <br> <br>
            purple laces meant queer pride. this was really useful to have since at that point in time, queer people were even worse off than in
            today's society and so violence was very common. this way, people could still express themselves but eveyrbody outside of their close 
            circle or the LGBTQ+ community would have no idea. yellow laces meant anti-racist however yellow is also a colour that often comes with
            docs so it could also just be as simple as that. this anti-racist movement was formed in response to some of the colours mentioned 
            earlier. also, while lace colours were usually not mixed together, an exception of that was purple and yellow (w combo if you ask me).
            <br> <br>

            soo i hope that fascinated you as much as it did me (im honestly not sure why it was so interesting... boredom does things to people yk)
            anyways this knowledge will now never be used again yayy! <br> <br>

            p.s. i just realised how much this sounds like a sorta rant you would send to someone at 3am. except its 6pm. but same thing whatever
