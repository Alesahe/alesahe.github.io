        <h2> <strong> 💙 a little museum 💙 </strong> </h2>
        <p> 
            the wall behind you gives out, making way for a rough cobblestone path. neatly trimmed bushes line the two
            sides near the start, where you are.

            <br> <br>

            and on either side, tall, haphazard cardboard buildings stand. you walk to the first &ndash; it's
            one from the inside of a pram, being pushed along to the park. <br> <br>

            the second has mint green walls and a black-and-white striped mattress. and a cot. inside, 
            a stack of books and a sleeping child. <br> <br>

            the third: a scene, a young child and a teacher and a sea of hundreds of people. a brown paper
            bag is waved around. <br> <br>

            you look around. <br>
