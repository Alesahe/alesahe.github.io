        <h2> <strong> 💙 a little museum 💙 </strong> </h2>
        <p> 
            you enter the double doors of a little museum. <br> <br>
            
            along one wall there are many taxidermied heads of animals - there's 
            an antelope, a rhino, gazelle. there are even more smaller fish and bats pinned, and a 
            full crocodile, lengthwise, staring blankly. <br> <br>

            along another wall is a series of light-coloured wooden cabinets with glass doors. more animals, their bones this time are lit up by
            a surprisingly warm, inviting light. a floor-to-ceiling case to your left has a human, standing upright, looking
            straight ahead. they look almost alive but don't stare back at you. <br> <br>

            on the other side is a plain white marble table. it's clear of most things but a lone fox stares 
            off into the distance on all four legs. <br> <br>

            in the middle of the room is a curious brown-gold globe. it's mounted on three dark wooden legs, on a raised pedestal. 
            you don't understand its symbols and inscriptions or how it moves, but slowly revolves, almost unnoticeable. <br> <br>

            you look up. on the ceiling, warm lights dance amongst spears, pinned butterflies, starfish, the pelts of cheetahs, kangaroos and golden ornaments throughout all of it. <br> <br>

            a plaque at the base reads "the little museum of curiosities" <br> <br>

            you wonder who this place belongs to <br> <br>
            
            you notice that amongst the assortment of cabinets, there's an <a href="doorway.html" style="color: #ebf7ff;">open doorway</a> directly ahead. <br> <br>
            
            <!-- open doorway in front (giant skeleton of some plesiosaur idk whatever u want), side door, janitors room, locked door-->
