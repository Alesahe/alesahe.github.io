        <h2> <strong> 💙 a little museum 💙 </strong> </h2>
        <p> 
            you enter the double doors of a little museum. <br> <br>
            
            along one wall there are many taxidermied heads of animals - there's 
            an antelope, a rhino, gazelle. there are a few more smaller fish and bats pinned. <br> <br>

            along another wall is a series of wooden cabinets with glass doors. more animals, their bones this time, lit up by
            a surprisingly warm, inviting light. <br> <br>

            on the other side is a plain white marble table. it's clear of most things but a lone fox stares off into the distance, upright. <br> <br>

            in the middle of the room is a curious brown-gold globe. it's mounted on three dark wooden legs, on a raised pedestal. 
            you don't understand its symbols and inscriptions or how to turn it to see the other side. <br> <br>

            you look up. warm lights dance amongst spears, pinned butterflies, starfish, the pelts of cheetahs, kangaroos and golden ornaments throughout all of it. <br> <br>
